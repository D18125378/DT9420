    "#### Methods that are implemented by the list object:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The count method counts the number of times a certain object appears in a list.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "list = [1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 2]\n",
    "list.count(2)\n",
    "output = 3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The remove method removes a selected variable from a list.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "list = [1, 2, 3, 2, 4]\n",
    "list.remove(2)\n",
    "output = [1, 3, 4]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The reverse method reverses the order of the objects within a list. \n",
    "```python\n",
    "list = [1, 2, 3, 2, 4]\n",
    "list.reverse()\n",
    "output = [4, 2, 3, 2, 1]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Implementing a counter in a **for** loop:\n",
    " - You can implement a counter in a for loop by adding it into the algorithm for the loop. This is done by telling the loop to run x number of times (for example, the number of items in the list), including a count=0 for the first loop. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "count = 0\n",
    "while count is less than #itemsinlist\n",
    "do the task once\n",
    "count = count + 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- Every third item can be retrieved from a list by using return[::3].\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Module Importation: \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Working with directories and paths:** The module for using paths can be imported using **from pathlib import Path**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Working with dates and times:** The datetime module is imported using **import.datetime**. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Working with common data interchange formats:** Modules for common data formats can be imported into python. For example, csv files can be imported using **import.csv**. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tuples\n",
    "\n",
    "- Tuples are similar to lists in that they are collections of variables. However, the objects in a tuple can't be changed, whereas those in a list can. Tuples are faster than lists, so are beneficial when you know the variables will not need to be changed. Tuples are also useful for dictionary-type functions. Similarly, lists are useful for when you know that variables may change. \n"
